# Deployment Guide

This document explains how to deploy Jumpstart in a production-oriented setup and how to recover when deployment issues happen.

## 1. Hosting Platforms

### Recommended production setup

- **Frontend:** Vercel
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Backend API:** Node-capable host such as Render, Railway, Fly.io, VPS, or container platform

### Important platform note

The current backend is a long-running Express server started with:

```bash
npm run start
```

That means:

- the **frontend** is ready for Vercel as-is
- the **database** is ready for MongoDB Atlas as-is
- the **backend is not currently packaged for Vercel serverless functions**

If you want backend-on-Vercel later, you will need to refactor the API entry point into Vercel-compatible serverless handlers.

## 2. Build Commands

## Frontend

From `frontend/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Vercel settings:

- **Framework Preset:** Vite
- **Root Directory:** `frontend`
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `dist`

## Backend

From `backend/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Useful pre-deploy checks:

```bash
node --check server.js
npm run smoke:career-500q
```

There is no separate backend build step in the current codebase.

## 3. Environment Variables

Set production variables in the hosting platform, not in committed `.env` files.

## Frontend production variables

- `VITE_API_URL`
  Public base URL for the deployed backend API, for example:
  `https://api.yourdomain.com/api`

- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
  Google OAuth client ID used by the frontend login flow

If `VITE_API_URL` is wrong:

- login will fail
- dashboard and result screens will fail
- admin screens will fail

## Backend production variables

- `PORT`
  Port exposed by the backend host. Many hosts inject this automatically.

- `MONGODB_URI`
  MongoDB Atlas connection string

- `JWT_SECRET`
  Long random secret used for JWT signing

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
  Same Google OAuth client ID used by the frontend

- `ADMIN_NAME`
  Seeded admin display name

- `ADMIN_EMAIL`
  Seeded admin email

- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  Seeded admin password

If `MONGODB_URI` or `JWT_SECRET` is missing:

- backend startup will fail immediately

## Example production variable mapping

### Frontend

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com/api
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

### Backend

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>/<db>
JWT_SECRET=<long-random-secret>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
ADMIN_NAME=Jumpstart Admin
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<strong-password>
```

## 4. Deployment Steps

## Step 1: Prepare MongoDB Atlas

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
2. Create a database user.
3. Add the backend host IP or allow trusted access rules.
4. Copy the MongoDB connection string.
5. Save it as `MONGODB_URI` in your backend host.

If skipped:

- backend cannot connect to the database

## Step 2: Deploy the backend

Use a Node host such as Render or Railway.

Typical backend settings:

- **Root Directory:** `backend`
- **Install Command:** `npm install`
- **Start Command:** `npm run start`

Before making the service public, set:

- `MONGODB_URI`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `ADMIN_NAME`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

After deploy:

1. open the backend root URL
2. check `/api/health`
3. confirm the backend logs show a successful MongoDB connection

Recommended post-deploy seed commands:

```bash
npm run seed:assessment
npm run seed:admin
```

Run those from the deployed backend environment or your connected production shell.

If skipped:

- packages may not exist in production
- admin login may not exist in production

## Step 3: Deploy the frontend on Vercel

1. Import the repository into Vercel.
2. Set the project root to `frontend`.
3. Use:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
4. Add frontend environment variables:
   - `VITE_API_URL`
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
5. Deploy.

After deploy:

1. open the Vercel URL
2. verify package listing loads
3. verify login works
4. verify admin routes can reach the backend

## Step 4: Configure Google OAuth

In Google Cloud Console:

1. add the frontend production domain as an allowed origin
2. use the same client ID in:
   - frontend `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - backend `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

If skipped:

- Google login button may render
- Google login will still fail at runtime

## Step 5: Production smoke check

Run this after both frontend and backend are live:

- open `/`
- open `/login`
- login with email/password
- test admin login
- load `/test`
- load `/result`
- hit backend `/api/health`

## 5. CI/CD Overview

There is no committed GitHub Actions workflow in this repo today.

Recommended CI pipeline:

1. install backend dependencies
2. install frontend dependencies
3. run backend smoke script
4. run frontend lint
5. run frontend build

Recommended CD flow:

- push to `main`
- CI validates smoke/build checks
- hosting platforms auto-deploy on successful merge

### Recommended GitHub Actions checks

```yaml
- run: cd backend && npm install && npm run smoke:career-500q
- run: cd frontend && npm install && npm run lint
- run: cd frontend && npm run build
```

If CI is missing:

- broken builds may reach production
- regressions in scoring or route imports may only be found after deploy

## 6. Domain Setup

## Frontend domain

Point your main app domain to Vercel, for example:

- `app.example.com`

## Backend domain

Point your API domain to the backend host, for example:

- `api.example.com`

Then update:

- frontend `VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com/api`

### SSL / HTTPS

Use HTTPS on both frontend and backend.

If frontend is HTTPS and backend is HTTP:

- browser requests may be blocked as mixed content

## 7. Rollback Strategy

Deployment failures will happen. Keep rollback simple.

### Frontend rollback

Vercel supports rolling back to a previous deployment from the dashboard.

Use rollback when:

- the UI deploys but pages fail to load
- admin or auth routes break after a release
- environment variables were changed incorrectly

### Backend rollback

Use your backend host’s previous deploy/release rollback if available.

If not available:

1. redeploy the previous known-good commit
2. restore previous environment variables if they changed
3. restart the service

### Database rollback

Prefer forward fixes over destructive rollback.

Safe options:

- restore from MongoDB Atlas backup if data corruption occurred
- re-run seed scripts if configuration data was lost

Be careful:

- rolling back code without checking schema/data compatibility can create new failures

## 8. Common Deployment Failures and Fixes

### Failure: frontend loads but API calls fail

Cause:

- `VITE_API_URL` is wrong
- backend is down
- CORS or domain mismatch

Fix:

- verify backend health endpoint
- verify `VITE_API_URL`
- redeploy frontend after correcting env vars

### Failure: backend crashes on boot

Cause:

- missing `MONGODB_URI`
- missing `JWT_SECRET`
- bad MongoDB credentials

Fix:

- verify backend environment variables
- verify Atlas user/password
- verify IP allowlist / network access

### Failure: login works locally but fails in production

Cause:

- frontend and backend are using different Google client IDs
- production frontend domain is not allowed in Google Cloud Console

Fix:

- use the same Google client ID in both apps
- add the deployed frontend origin in Google Cloud Console

### Failure: admin panel opens but no data loads

Cause:

- backend API unreachable
- stale token
- backend seed data missing

Fix:

- check `/api/health`
- log out and log back in
- run `npm run seed:assessment`
- run `npm run seed:admin`

### Failure: test packages do not appear in production

Cause:

- assessment config not seeded
- production database is empty

Fix:

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed:assessment
```

### Failure: backend deploys but scoring fails for 500Q workflows

Cause:

- reference assets missing from deploy artifact
- scoring-related scripts or generated config not present

Fix:

- verify `backend/reference/` is included in deploy source
- verify `backend/config/comprehensive500Package.generated.js` exists
- run `npm run smoke:career-500q` before deploy

## 9. Recommended Production Validation Checklist

Before signing off a release:

- backend health endpoint returns `200`
- frontend loads from Vercel
- login works
- admin login works
- package list loads
- purchase/select flow works
- result pages load
- admin submissions/results screens load
- Google login works if enabled
