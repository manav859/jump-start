# How Jumpstart Scores Your Assessment

This document explains how the test you take becomes a career profile — first in plain English (for students, parents, counsellors, and anyone evaluating the platform), then in technical detail (for developers maintaining the system).

## For Clients: How Your Score Is Calculated

### The 5 Sections — what each one measures

Every Jumpstart assessment is built from five distinct sections. Each one measures something different about you, and each one tells the career algorithm something different about which paths suit you.

| # | Section | What it measures | Why it matters for career guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Personality Assessment** | How you think, behave, and prefer to work — based on the Big Five (OCEAN), HSPQ, work-style, and leadership traits | A surgeon and a graphic designer can both be brilliant, but they need different temperaments. Personality predicts day-to-day fit. |
| 2 | **Multiple Intelligence** | Eight types of intelligence — logical-mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic | A natural strength in one type points to fields that lean on that strength every day. |
| 3 | **Interest Assessment** | Your Holland Code (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional) plus subject and activity preferences | Interest predicts what you'll stay engaged with over a 30-year career, not just what you're good at today. |
| 4 | **Aptitude Battery** | Verbal, numerical, abstract, spatial, mechanical, and clerical reasoning — measured objectively, not self-reported | These are the closest thing to a "skill ceiling" we can measure on paper. A lawyer needs strong verbal aptitude; an engineer needs strong spatial and numerical. |
| 5 | **Emotional Intelligence** | Self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, social skills | EQ is the single biggest predictor of long-term career success across most fields. |

### How scores come together

The process happens in three stages:

1. **Each question is graded.** Likert questions (the "Strongly agree → Strongly disagree" ones) are scored on a 1-5 scale and averaged. Objective questions (multiple-choice with one right answer) are graded as correct or incorrect against an answer key. Questions you didn't answer are skipped — they don't count for or against you.

2. **Each subsection produces a score.** Big Five OCEAN, Holland Codes, and so on each get their own 0-100 score. If you only answered some of a subsection, the score reflects only what you actually answered — not a penalty for the rest.

3. **Each section produces a 0-100 score.** The subsection scores are averaged within each section.

4. **Your overall score is a weighted average** of the five section scores:

   | Section | Weight |
   |---|---:|
   | Personality | 20% |
   | Multiple Intelligence | 20% |
   | Interest | 15% |
   | **Aptitude Battery** | **30%** |
   | Emotional Intelligence | 15% |

### Why aptitude carries the most weight

Sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 ask you to **describe yourself** ("I enjoy taking initiative when working with others — Strongly Agree / Disagree"). You might be a little too generous, or a little too modest, or simply not see yourself clearly yet. That's normal — self-perception is a real signal, but it can drift.

Section 4 — the **Aptitude Battery** — is the only section where you can't talk yourself up or down. Either you can solve the verbal reasoning question or you can't. Either the gear rotates clockwise or it doesn't. That makes Aptitude the most reliable signal in the test, which is why it carries the heaviest weight (30%) in the overall score.

### How career matching works

After your scores are computed, the algorithm compares your profile against a database of **129 careers**. Each career has a "fingerprint" — primary and secondary Holland codes, the intelligences it draws on most, the aptitudes it depends on, and the EQ competencies it rewards.

The match score for each career is calculated across four dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What it asks |
|---|---:|---|
| **Holland Codes** (Realistic / Investigative / Artistic / Social / Enterprising / Conventional) | 35% | Does this career sit in interest areas you scored high on? |
| **Multiple Intelligences** (Logical-Math, Linguistic, Spatial, Musical, Bodily-Kinesthetic, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, Naturalistic) | 25% | Does this career lean on intelligences you're strong in? |
| **Aptitudes** (Verbal, Numerical, Abstract, Spatial Relations, Mechanical, Clerical, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving) | 30% | Does the career need aptitudes where you scored well? |
| **EQ Competencies** (Empathy, Motivation, Self-Regulation, Social Skills, Self-Awareness) | 10% | Does the career reward the EQ areas where you're strongest? |

For Holland codes, the **primary** code in a career's fingerprint counts at full weight; **secondary** codes count at 60% weight. That's because a career like "Architect" is principally Artistic (A) but also draws on Investigative (I) and Realistic (R) — the secondary codes shape it but don't define it.

> **Differentiation tuning.** Aptitude carries a slightly heavier weight (30%) than intelligence/Holland alone because it's the only objective, right/wrong signal and varies most between students. EQ is deliberately light (10%): Social Skills and Motivation run high for almost every sociable student and are required by a large share of careers, so a heavy EQ weight used to add a flat lift that floated every business/people career (Sales Manager especially) to the top regardless of a student's actual interests. The intelligence and aptitude buckets also **peak-reward** the student's single strongest aligned dimension (not just a flat average), so a genuine spike — e.g. high Musical intelligence — pulls the careers that need it.

### What a match percentage means

When a career card says "87% match", it means:

> Your profile aligns strongly with this career across all four dimensions — your dominant interests, intelligences, aptitudes, and EQ traits all point in this direction.

A match in the **80-100%** range is a strong fit — worth exploring seriously. **60-79%** is a solid alignment worth considering. **Below 60%** suggests a career where you'd have to work against your natural grain on at least one dimension.

The "Why this matched you" section under each career card lists the specific signals that lifted it to the top — so you can see exactly which of your strengths the algorithm latched onto.

### How the demo differs from the full test

| | Demo Test | Full 500Q Test |
|---|---|---|
| Questions | 50 | 500 |
| Sections | 5 (curated subset) | 5 (full bank) |
| Algorithm | **Identical** | Identical |
| Career database | Same 129 | Same 129 |
| Match weights | Same | Same |
| Section weights | Same (20/20/15/30/15) | Same |

The demo is **not** a different algorithm — it's the same scoring engine running on a smaller question set. With fewer questions per subsection (1-3 instead of 10-30), individual subsections give a **directional** rather than **precise** read on you. The overall score and career recommendations are valid, but a full 500Q result gives a noticeably more nuanced picture.

### Manual review

For a small number of questions where the algorithm can't make a confident call — for example, if an answer key were missing or marked ambiguous — the system flags those for **manual admin review** before the result is published. Currently every Section 4 question has a definitive answer key, so manual review doesn't trigger in normal operation. If it ever does, the admin reviews each flagged question, makes a decision, and only then is the result released to the student.

## For Developers: Scoring Architecture

### Scoring dispatch flow

Every assessment submission flows through one entry point:

```
POST /api/v1/user/test-submit                       (userController.js)
  └─→ computeAssessmentResult({ answers, sections, packageId })
        ↓
        backend/utils/scoring/index.js dispatches by packageId:
          ├─ "demo-aptitude-50q"      → scoreCareer500QDemoPackage(answers, sections)
          ├─ "complete-aptitude-500q" → scoreCareer500QPackage(answers, sections)
          └─ else                     → computeGenericResultFromAnswers (heuristic fallback)
```

The demo wrapper internally delegates to `scoreCareer500QPackage` and then post-processes the result (re-bands aptitude, recomputes overall, re-runs the career matcher with `topN=6`, stamps demo-specific metadata).

### Section weights — rationale

| sectionId | Section | Weight | Why this weight |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Personality Assessment | 0.20 | Self-reported; describes day-to-day fit. Important but susceptible to bias. |
| 2 | Multiple Intelligence | 0.20 | Self-reported; broad strengths signal. |
| 3 | Interest Assessment | 0.15 | Self-reported; interests are mutable over time. Lower weight than personality. |
| 4 | **Aptitude Battery** | **0.30** | Objective. Hardest to manipulate. Strongest predictor of skill ceiling. |
| 5 | Emotional Intelligence | 0.15 | Self-reported and partially developmental. Lower weight to avoid double-counting with personality. |

Weights live in `SECTION_WEIGHTS` in [career500q.js](../backend/utils/scoring/packageScoring/career500q.js) and mirrored in [career500qDemo.js](../backend/utils/scoring/packageScoring/career500qDemo.js). Sections with null percentages are dropped from the weighted average and the remaining weights are renormalised — partial completions don't get penalised.

### Likert scoring

- Scale: 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)
- Reverse-scored items use `invertedValue = 6 - rawValue` before averaging (e.g., a "1" on a reverse item is treated as a "5")
- Subsection average: `sum(answered values) / answeredCount` — unanswered items skipped from both numerator and denominator
- Percentage normalisation: `((average - 1) / 4) * 100` → maps 1-5 to 0-100
- Band thresholds (applied to the 1-5 average, which is mathematically equivalent to applying to the 0-100 percentage):

  | Band | Average | Percentage equivalent |
  |---|---|---|
  | High | 4.0-5.0 | 75-100% |
  | Moderate | 3.0-3.99 | 50-74% |
  | Low | 1.0-2.99 | 0-49% |

Reverse-question IDs are defined per factor in [career500q.config.js](../backend/utils/scoring/configs/career500q.config.js). Verified against the source PDF answer key.

### Objective scoring

- Both student answer and answer key are trimmed and upper-cased before comparison (`normalizeAnswerLetter`)
- Unanswered questions are skipped from the correct count — they neither help nor hurt
- Questions without an answer key (`!correctOption` OR `isManualReviewRequired(question) === true`) are excluded from BOTH the numerator AND the scorable denominator — they flow into `manualReviewItems` instead
- Percentage: `(correctCount / scorableCount) * 100`
- Band thresholds (percentage-based, applied uniformly to demo and full):

  | Band | Percentage |
  |---|---|
  | Excellent | 80-100% |
  | Good | 60-79% |
  | Average | 40-59% |
  | Developing | 0-39% |

Per-subsection interpretation strings ("Excellent verbal reasoning. Law, journalism, literature.") are pulled from the config bands by label and overlaid on the percentage-derived band.

### Preference scoring (point-accumulation)

The Section 3 preference blocks are **not** agree/disagree Likert items and are **not** averaged. They are single-choice (A/B/C), and each chosen option **adds one point** to the trait it maps to. After all questions, the trait with the most points is the dominant signal. This is point-accumulation, the opposite of the 1–5 averaging used elsewhere.

**Activity Preferences (Q255–Q272) → Holland (RIASEC).** Each option maps to a Holland type via six recurring dimension rows (`optionRiasecMap` / `ACTIVITY_RIASEC_OPTION_MAP` in [career500q.config.js](../backend/utils/scoring/configs/career500q.config.js); scored by `scoreActivityRiasec`). The accumulated counts are folded into the six RIASEC interest signals in `buildFlattenedSignals` (blended with the Q201–Q236 Likert RIASEC averages), so activity choices feed career matching directly:

| Dimension (questions) | Option A → | Option B → | Option C → |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stream Indicators (Q255, 261, 267) | Realistic | Social | Investigative |
| Holland Type (Q256, 262, 268) | Investigative | Enterprising | Artistic |
| Work Style (Q257, 263, 269) | Artistic | Conventional | Realistic |
| Career Focus (Q258, 264, 270) | Social | Realistic | Enterprising |
| Activity Type (Q259, 265, 271) | Enterprising | Investigative | Conventional |
| Environment (Q260, 266, 272) | Conventional | Artistic | Social |

> **Rebalanced (clustering fix).** The earlier rows left **Conventional unreachable** (0 of 54 option-slots) and **Enterprising barely reachable** (6), while R/I/A/S each had 12. Because the activity intensity is averaged with the Likert RIASEC, a genuinely Conventional student had their C score halved and the block could never pull anyone toward C — so it couldn't correct Likert inflation for half the spectrum. The rows above are balanced: across the six rows each Holland code appears exactly once per option column, giving every code equal coverage (9 of 54 slots) and making all six reachable.

**Work Environment (Q273–Q290) → work-environment profile.** Each A/B/C option maps to one of four profiles — Research / Quiet / Independent, Collaborative / People / Service, Dynamic / Leadership / Business, Creative / Flexible / Innovative — via an explicit per-question `optionProfileMap` in [career500q.config.js](../backend/utils/scoring/configs/career500q.config.js) (scored by `scoreEnvironmentProfile`). **Every option maps to exactly one profile** — there is no unmatched/unscored option. Scoring is point-accumulation; the highest-count profile is the dominant work-environment preference. (This replaced earlier fragile keyword matching that left options such as "An office with regular business hours" unscored.)

**Subject Preferences (Q237–Q254)** are the exception in Section 3: they are interest-rated 1–5 and **averaged** into four subject clusters (STEM, Humanities, Arts, Social Sciences) — averaging, not accumulation.

The full per-option mapping for every Section 3 preference question is printed in [`backend/exports/section3-interest-assessment.md`](../backend/exports/section3-interest-assessment.md), regenerated by `npm run export:answer-keys`.

### Personality type derivation (MBTI)

`buildPersonalityType({ bigFiveSection, emotionalSection })` in [career500q.js](../backend/utils/scoring/packageScoring/career500q.js).

The MBTI type is **derived**, not measured by its own questionnaire — it falls out of OCEAN (Section 1) + EQ (Section 5). Each dimension scores **both poles from genuinely opposing signals** and picks whichever pole is relatively stronger for the individual student. The pre-go-live audit caught and replaced an old fixed-50% threshold that pushed 5 of 8 stored full-test reports onto the same ENFJ-A type — the new relative comparison spreads outputs across the 16 types based on which signals genuinely dominate.

| Dim | Winner logic |
|---|---|
| E vs I | `extraversion%` vs `100 − extraversion%` — higher wins |
| N vs S | `openness%` vs `100 − openness%` — higher wins |
| F vs T | F = `agreeableness × 0.6 + empathy × 0.4`; T = `conscientiousness × 0.6 + self_regulation × 0.4` — higher wins |
| J vs P | J = `conscientiousness × 0.7 + self_regulation × 0.3`; P = `openness × 0.7 + motivation × 0.3` — higher wins |
| A vs T (suffix) | `assertive = emotionalStability × 0.6 + self_regulation × 0.25 + motivation × 0.15` — ≥ 60 → A, < 60 → T (threshold raised from 50 because neuroticism skews low in self-report) |

Where `emotionalStability = likertToPercent(6 − neuroticismAverage)`. The returned `personalityType.metrics` carries both poles per dimension (`eScore/iScore/nScore/sScore/fScore/tScore/jScore/pScore`) so admin tooling can surface "close calls" (e.g. J=51, P=49). See [PERSONALITY_ASSESSMENT.md — MBTI Derivation](PERSONALITY_ASSESSMENT.md#mbti-derivation--relative-comparison-current-formula) for the full rationale and the counsellor borderline-score guidance.

### Career matching formula

Implemented in [careerMatcher.js](../backend/utils/scoring/careerMatcher.js). One function: `matchCareers(profile, topN = 10)`.

**Input profile shape** (any missing field defaults to neutral score 50):

```js
{
  hollandProfile:        { R, I, A, S, E, C },              // 0-100 each
  multipleIntelligences: { "Logical-Math", "Linguistic", ... }, // 8 keys, 0-100 each
  aptitudeScores:        { "Verbal", "Numerical", ... },         // 8 keys, 0-100 each
  eqProfile:             { "Empathy", "Motivation", ... }        // 5 keys, 0-100 each
}
```

**Question ranges feeding each bucket** (full mapping in [CAREER_MATCHING.md — Question-to-career-dimension mapping](CAREER_MATCHING.md#question-to-career-dimension-mapping)):

| Bucket | Section | Question range | Per-key range |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hollandProfile` | Section 3 | Q201–Q236 | R: Q201–206 · I: Q207–212 · A: Q213–218 · S: Q219–224 · E: Q225–230 · C: Q231–236 |
| `multipleIntelligences` | Section 2 | Q121–Q200 | 10 questions per intelligence, in order |
| `aptitudeScores` | Section 4 | Q291–Q450 | 8 subsections — Verbal Q291–315, Numerical Q316–340, Abstract Q341–365, Spatial Q366–390, Mechanical Q391–410, Clerical Q411–430, Critical Thinking Q431–440, Problem Solving Q441–450 |
| `eqProfile` | Section 5 | Q451–Q500 | Self-Awareness Q451–460 · Self-Regulation Q461–470 · Motivation Q471–480 · Empathy Q481–490 · Social Skills Q491–500 |

**Acquiescence correction (interest de-biasing).** Before the six `hollandProfile` values reach the matcher, `buildFlattenedSignals` runs them through `ipsatizeInterestScores`. The RIASEC Likert (Q201–236) has no reverse-keyed items, so a high-energy "yes to everything" student inflates all six interest types together — collapsing the highest-weighted match component toward a common Enterprising/Social shape and clustering everyone onto the same business/people careers. Ipsatizing re-centers each student's six scores on their own mean (a flat profile maps to flat 50, not E/S-dominant) and amplifies the genuine differential shape that remains (`gain 1.4`). This affects only the career-matcher input — the RIASEC bars shown in the report still display the raw Likert averages.

**Per-career score:**

```
careerScore =   hollandMatch       × 0.35
              + intelligenceMatch  × 0.25
              + aptitudeMatch      × 0.30
              + eqMatch            × 0.10
```

**Holland match** — primary-dominant: the primary code carries 75% of the score, secondary codes split the remaining 25% (so a career is scored mainly on how well the student's interest matches its principal theme; secondaries are a bonus that can't drag the primary below itself):

```js
const PRIMARY_HOLLAND_WEIGHT = 0.75;
const codes = career.hollandCodes;                  // primary first
const primary = profile.hollandProfile[codes[0]] ?? 50;   // already ipsatized upstream
if (codes.length === 1) return clamp(primary);
const secondaryAvg = average(codes.slice(1).map((c) => profile.hollandProfile[c] ?? 50));
return clamp(primary * PRIMARY_HOLLAND_WEIGHT + secondaryAvg * (1 - PRIMARY_HOLLAND_WEIGHT));
```

> This replaced an earlier formula that averaged primary (1.0×) with each secondary (0.6×). That averaging let a single-code career (e.g. Sales Manager `["E"]`) take the student's full E with no dilution, while a multi-code career whose **primary** matched the student's peak (e.g. Banking `["C","E"]` for a C-dominant student) was pulled *below* its primary — so single-code business/people careers won unfairly. Anchoring on the primary fixes that.

**Intelligence/Aptitude match** — a peak-rewarded blend so a genuine spike pulls the careers that need it, instead of a flat average washing out individuality. **EQ match** stays a straight average at low weight (peak-rewarding it would re-introduce the flat people-skills lift):

```js
const PEAK_BLEND = 0.4;
const values = career.intelligenceTypes.map(
  (name) => profile.multipleIntelligences[name] ?? 50
);
const avg = average(values), peak = Math.max(...values);
return clamp(avg * (1 - PEAK_BLEND) + peak * PEAK_BLEND);   // EQ: return clamp(avg)
```

**Output per career:**

```js
{
  title:        "Astronomer",
  category:     "Science & Research",
  score:        91.2,                    // 0-100, one decimal
  matchPercent: 91,                      // legacy field, equals Math.round(score)
  hollandCodes:        ["I"],
  intelligenceTypes:   ["Logical-Math", "Spatial"],
  aptitudeStrengths:   ["Numerical", "Abstract", "Spatial Relations"],
  eqCompetencies:      ["Motivation"],
  breakdown: {
    hollandMatch:       88,
    intelligenceMatch:  88,
    aptitudeMatch:     100,
    eqMatch:            88
  },
  matchReasons: {
    holland:      "Your dominant interest code I (Investigative) aligns with this path.",
    intelligence: "Strong intelligence signals in Logical-Math and Spatial.",
    aptitude:     "Strong aptitude scores in Numerical, Abstract, and Spatial Relations.",
    eq:           "High EQ in Motivation."
  }
}
```

**matchReasons generation** — for each dimension, the matcher checks which of the career's required signals scored ≥ 60% on the student's profile. If at least one signal cleared the bar, the reason reads as "Strong/High … in X and Y". Otherwise it reads as "this career leans on X, Y — partial match on your current profile."

**Worked example — Software Engineer.** Career fingerprint: `hollandCodes ["I","R"]`, `intelligenceTypes ["Logical-Math","Spatial-Visual"]`, `aptitudeStrengths ["Numerical","Abstract"]`, `eqCompetencies ["Self-Regulation","Motivation"]`. Student profile: `I=85, R=72`, `Logical-Math=90, Spatial=75`, `Numerical=88, Abstract=80`, `Self-Reg=70, Motivation=75`.

```
hollandMatch       = 85 × 0.75 + 72 × 0.25                =  81.75  // primary-dominant
intelligenceMatch  = 0.6 × avg(90,75) + 0.4 × max(90,75)  =  85.5   // peak-rewarded
aptitudeMatch      = 0.6 × avg(88,80) + 0.4 × max(88,80)  =  85.6   // peak-rewarded
eqMatch            = (70 + 75) / 2                        =  72.5   // straight average

careerScore = 81.75 × 0.35 + 85.5 × 0.25 + 85.6 × 0.30 + 72.5 × 0.10
            = 28.6125 + 21.375 + 25.680 + 7.250
            = 82.9 %
```

The student sees **83% Match** on the Software Engineer card (`matchPercent = Math.round(score)`).

**Display rules** — applied to the top-N before rendering:

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Minimum match threshold | 60% (careers below drop off) |
| Minimum careers shown | 3 (top by score, even if below 60% — so a low-signal profile still gets results) |
| Maximum careers shown — full test | 15 |
| Maximum careers shown — demo | 10 |
| Sort | Highest match % first, ties alphabetical |

Threshold + floor live in `MATCH_THRESHOLD` and `MIN_RESULTS` in [careerMatcher.js](../backend/utils/scoring/careerMatcher.js); the caps come from each scorer's `matchCareers(profile, topN)` call.

### Manual review trigger

Implemented as `isManualReviewRequired(question)` in [career500qEvaluationSpec.js](../backend/utils/scoring/specs/career500qEvaluationSpec.js). Returns true ONLY when:

1. `correctAnswer` / `correctOption` is `null`, `undefined`, or empty string
2. `correctAnswer` is explicitly flagged ambiguous (string equals "ambiguous", "review", or "?")
3. `evaluationType` / `type` is set to a value not in `["objective", "single", "multiple_choice", "likert"]`

The presence or absence of an image is **irrelevant** — image rendering is a UI concern, not a grading concern.

Currently every one of the 160 Section-4 questions has a valid `correctOption`, so `manualReviewItems` is empty for every submission and `hasUnreviewedItems` is `false`. Approval is never blocked unless a future edit blanks an answer key.

### Demo scorer — 5-step recompute order

[career500qDemo.js](../backend/utils/scoring/packageScoring/career500qDemo.js) runs the full scorer then post-processes:

```
1. Re-band aptitude subsection scores using demo percentage bands
   (DEMO_APTITUDE_BANDS from career500qDemo.config.js)
2. Recompute Section 4 percentage from re-banded subsections
3. Recompute overallScore using the weighted formula
4. Recompute completedSections + completionStatus
5. Re-run matchCareers with topN = 6
6. Stamp metadata LAST:
   - algorithmKey:    "career-500q-demo-v1"
   - packageId:       "demo-aptitude-50q"
   - overallMaxScore: 100
```

Stamping last ensures nothing downstream can clobber the demo identity.

### Algorithm versioning

Every result records its algorithm version in `metadata.algorithmKey`:

| Key | Source |
|---|---|
| `career-500q-v1` | Full 500-question scorer |
| `career-500q-demo-v1` | Demo wrapper (50-question curated subset) |
| `generic-profile` | Heuristic fallback for non-500Q packages |

If the scoring logic changes in a way that affects stored results, increment the version (`-v2`) so old reports remain identifiable for migration/comparison.

npm run smoke:career-500q
```

The smoke runs six scenarios (full+demo × all-correct/all-wrong/mixed) and asserts: completion is `Complete` and `5/5`, all-correct overall > 70, all-wrong overall < 40, all-correct vs all-wrong spread ≥ 30 points, `manualReviewItems.length` equals the count of Section-4 questions missing an answer key (0 currently), `hasUnreviewedItems` matches whether items exist, top recommendations are distinct. Output ends with `[OK] All scoring contracts pass.`
