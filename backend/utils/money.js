 * Split a GST-INCLUSIVE total into its taxable base and the tax inside it.
 *
 * `gst` is deliberately the REMAINDER (`total - base`), never rounded on its
 * own. Rounding both halves independently lets them sum to total ± 1 paisa;
 * taking one as the remainder makes `base + gst === total` true by
 * construction, for every input, with no reconciliation step.
 *
 * The caller must pass the amount ACTUALLY CHARGED (post-discount). Tax is
 * owed on the consideration received, so splitting a pre-discount list price
 * overstates the tax whenever a coupon is in play.
 *
 * @param {number} totalPaise inclusive total, integer paise
 * @returns {{ base: number, gst: number, total: number, gstRate: number }}
