// Payment model — the gateway ledger.
//
// One document per Razorpay ORDER, written at order-creation time and
// updated as the payment resolves. This records every order including ones
// that are never paid, which `User.purchaseHistory` deliberately does not:
// that array is the student's receipt list and only ever receives paid
// purchases.
//
// Why both places
// ---------------
// purchaseHistory answers "what did this student buy" and is read by the
// student UI and the admin Payments table. This collection answers "what
// happened at the gateway" — including abandoned checkouts and signature
// failures — and is the record we reconcile against Razorpay.
//
// It is also the trust anchor for verification: verifyPayment resolves the
// package, amount and coupon from THIS document (matched on
// razorpayOrderId) rather than from the client, so a tampered client
// payload cannot change what was purchased or for how much.
